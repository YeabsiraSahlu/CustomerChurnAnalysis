Customer Churn Prediction

Description
This project is designed to predict customer churn using logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm. Customer churn, or the likelihood of customers discontinuing their use of a service, is a critical metric for many businesses. Effective churn prediction can help companies take proactive measures to retain clients and better understand customer behaviors.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Implements several preprocessing steps that are essential for machine learning models, including:

Handling Missing Values: Automatically fills missing entries in the dataset to maintain data integrity.
Categorical Variable Encoding: Converts categorical data into numeric formats, making it suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Feature Scaling: Standardizes the range of independent variables, improving the performance of the logistic regression model.
Logistic Regression Model: Utilizes a logistic regression algorithm, well-suited for binary classification tasks like churn prediction.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluates the model's accuracy and visualizes results using a confusion matrix to provide a clear picture of the model's performance.
